## My dots

List of configs to my keyboard-driven system. My point was to get light weight system without useless annoyances.

There are no install scripts atm and things are bit messy, so I wouldn't recommend cloning my entire setup, but instead to try copying bits and pieces as you put together your own dotfiles unique to you.

### Todo

> Nothing is perfect but here are some important reminders what needs to be done

- [ ] Add install script to setup environment after Void install
- [ ] Add list of all the key binds, for this I need to make some sort of parser script because things live in the river init
- [ ] Adding Sources for Inspiration
